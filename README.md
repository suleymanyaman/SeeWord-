# SeeWord-
A desktop application, working as a reminder, to make the acquisition of vocabulary in language learning easier. 


The program works via a MySQL database. As a user, you add the target language words you encounter in different sources to the the database
via add_item.py. This scripts adds the word, its meaning and an example sentence from spanishdict.com. The program, in certain time intervals
like 15 minutes, sends you a Windows 10 notification, consisting of a random word, its meaning and the example sentence. 

The updates to the projects wil follow soon.
