# SeeWord-
A desktop application, working as a reminder, to make the acquisition of vocabulary in language learning easier. 


The program works via a SQLite database. As a user, you add the target language words you encounter in different sources to the database
via UI panel. The program, every hour, sends you a Windows 10 notification, consisting of a random word, its meaning and the example sentence. The rationale behind is to keep the words within the attention of the learner.
