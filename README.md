# SeeWord-
A desktop application, working as a reminder, to make the acquisition of vocabulary in language learning easier. 


The program works via a MySQL database. As a user, you add the target language words you encounter in different sources to the database
via UI panel. The program, in certain time intervals
like 15 minutes, sends you a Windows 10 notification, consisting of a random word, its meaning and the example sentence. 

As there's not a dedicated setup for now, you can add the script to the StartUp folder in windows manually. (On the condition that a MySQL server like Xampp is installed on your computer.)

The updates to the projects will follow soon.
